## Ping pong assignment
Jiben Gigi and Matt Gostkowski

For this assignment, we will practice GitHub collaboration to train a neural network on the California housing dataset. This neural network will use the numerical predictors available in the CA housing dataset to predict MedHouseVal. We will also use train and test predictions to evaluate model fit and tune hyperparameters.  

### To run the code:
First, make sure you are in the correct working directory. 

Then, install the packages in the requirements.txt file:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the code:
python .\src\CA_housing_nn.py
